# Developer Guidelines

## Testing

### Unit Tests with Jest

```bash
cd client && yarn test
```

If you want to see `console.log` or more detail, add the `--verbose` flag.

If you want to see more HTML output, add `DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT=1000000` (or any large number).

If you want to access the testing playground, add `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` to your test (although if the URL is too long, the playground will be blank).

Front-end unit tests include snapshots. Work that changes the DOM will result in a diff from the last accepted snapshot and cause related tests to fail. You can update the snapshots and review / accept the diff with `yarn test -u`.

## Styling

### MUI v5

[Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) is a popular open-source UI framework for React applications that is based on Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides a wide range of reusable and customizable components and styles to help you build modern, attractive, and responsive web applications

Material-UI has been configured for Next.js app router using a theme registry component (/cas-registration/client/app/components/theme/ThemeRegistry.tsx) as a provider to the children within the root layout (/cas-registration/client/app/layout.tsx) and providing config option in client/next.config.js.
